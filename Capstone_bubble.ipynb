    "Bubble tea is a drink that is immensely popular in Southeast Asia, and has experienced a resurgence in popularity in recent years [1][2]. Although there was a lull in the expansion of the industry, it is now seeing a revival with new chains from China such as The Alley and Heytea entering the market. Globally, the bubble tea market is expected to reach 3.2 billion by 2023 [3], with Asia Pacific projected to be the second fastest growing region for the market. In this project, I will examine where a businessman, hoping to capitalize on this growing market, should open a bubble tea shop in Singapore. I will utilize foursquare API data to locate clusters of bubble tea shops, which indicates the current level of competition. Additionally, I will also utilize demographic data and overlap the two, to examine if there are regions that have a higher proportion of youths (which tend to drink more bubble tea) but have a lower proportion of bubble tea shops, which would indicate an opportunity to open a bubble tea shop."

    "While Singapore utilizes postal codes, there is a lack of granular public data (see Wikipedia [4]). The Singapore government splits the country up in 55 planning areas and 324 subzones from planning and statistical purposes. Hence, for the purpose of this project, I will be utilizing geographic data of the 324 subzones to represent neighbourhoods in Singapore. Geographic coordinates of each subzone are downloaded from a public Tableau map, where a csv file was generated [5].\n",
